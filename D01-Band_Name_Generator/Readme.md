# Day 1 – Band Name Generator 🎸

## What I Learned

* **Printing Output**
  Learned how to display messages to the user using the `print()` function.

* **Taking User Input**
  Used the `input()` function to ask questions and store the user's responses.

* **Variables**
  Stored user input (city name and pet name) inside variables for later use.

* **String Concatenation**
  Combined multiple strings and variables together using the `+` operator to form a meaningful sentence.

* **Basic Program Flow**
  Understood how a program runs line by line, from welcoming the user to producing the final output.

## Project Overview

The **Band Name Generator** is a simple Python program that generates a fun band name based on the user's personal inputs.
It asks for the name of the city the user grew up in and their pet’s name, then combines them to suggest a unique band name.

## How It Works

* The program first prints a welcome message.
* It prompts the user to enter:

  * The city they grew up in
  * Their pet’s name
* These inputs are stored in variables.
* The program concatenates the city name and pet name with a space in between.
* Finally, it prints the generated band name to the console.

## Code Highlights

* `print()` is used to display messages and results.
* `input()` is used to collect user input.
* Variables (`city`, `pet`) store user responses.
* String concatenation (`+`) combines text and variables into a final output.
